"""Measures how many real jobs Jobcu found (HANDOVER section 9.0, point 5).

You give it a list of jobs you found yourself — on LinkedIn, StepStone, Indeed, a company's own
page, anywhere — for a search you have already run in Jobcu. It says how many of them Jobcu found,
and for each one it missed, at which step it was lost: never collected by any source, left out
as clearly unrelated by the quick check, or left out by a place condition. The latest search's
every collected job is kept (`pool.py`), so the tool can tell these apart for that search.

Write the list as a plain text file, one job per line:

    Company | Job title | Place | https://link (the link is optional)

A company known by two names can be written "Össur / Embla Medical". A job counts as found only
when the company, the title and (when both are known) the town agree: another job of the same
company elsewhere doesn't count.

Lines starting with # are ignored. Then run:

    uv run python tools/coverage_test.py my-list.txt              the last search
    uv run python tools/coverage_test.py my-list.txt --search 7   a particular search

It reads the searches already saved in your data folder and sends no requests anywhere.
