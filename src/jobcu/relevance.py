"""The quick first pass (HANDOVER section 13, saving 5).

A cheap AI check on the title, company and first lines of each job, which leaves out
only jobs that are clearly unrelated to what the person wants (a nurse job for an
electronics engineer). When in doubt, a job is kept for full scoring. The titles left
out are listed in "Search details" so mistakes can be spotted.

The same pass reads where a job is when its job sites don't say: many Adzuna ads give only
"Deutschland" or "UK" while their text says "am Standort in Wietmarschen-Lohne". Only a town
the ad itself names is accepted, so the conditions about places and travel times can be applied
to these jobs too (`JobGroup.place_from_text`).

This must pass the quality test set before it's trusted (HANDOVER section 13).
