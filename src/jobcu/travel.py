"""Getting from a job to the places a condition measures to (HANDOVER section 6).

"At most 50 minutes by public transport to a city with at least 0.3% of the country's people"
is one condition: a limit (50 minutes, public transport) and reference places (the cities of
that size). A job in Fürstenfeldbruck fits it through Munich, although Fürstenfeldbruck itself
is small. `location.py` reads the condition; this module measures it for each job:

1. **Where the job is:** the coordinates the job ad gave, otherwise the centre of the district or
   town the ad names. Never a company's address from elsewhere: a company can have several sites
   with the same name (the owner's decision).
2. **Which reference places could be in reach:** straight-line distances rule out places no
   train or car could reach in time and settle jobs inside a reference town at once, so only
   the nearest few places in between are asked about.
   A reference place is where the person would live (the owner, 2026-09-24), so a reachable
   part of the city is enough unless the person asks for its centre. A city's own districts in
   the town list (Hamburg's Wandsbek) are part of the city, not reference places of their own.
3. **How long it takes:** Google Maps (the person's own key, the travel mode the person meant;
   public transport on a weekday morning, car without live traffic), within the configured monthly
   route limit. Sample the calculated edge and the centre, keeping the faster available journey:
   an arbitrary edge point may have a much slower connection than the centre. These samples do
   not establish the fastest journey to every part of a city. Without a key or beyond the limit,
   the AI estimates the times and the card says so.

Each job's answer is kept in the condition (minutes per reference place), so a corrected limit
is applied again without asking anyone. The AI's estimates are also remembered for 30 days (the
owner's decision): from the same town, or the same point a job ad gave, to the same place, by
the same way of travelling. Google's travel times are never kept beyond the search they were
asked for: the Routes API terms (section 19.3) allow keeping only coordinates, not durations.
