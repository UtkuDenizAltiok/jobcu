"""What Jobcu remembers about jobs between searches (HANDOVER section 12).

Only this is remembered: which jobs were shown before (for the "New" badge), which the user
marked Saved, Applied or Not interested, and the **text of ads already downloaded**, for a few
days, so the same ad isn't fetched again (DECISIONS.md). A job is recognised again through any
of its copies, so if one copy was marked Not interested, every copy stays hidden. Scores and
everything else about a search are always made fresh.
