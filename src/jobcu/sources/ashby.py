"""Ashby career sites, through Ashby's public Job Postings API (documented for building career
pages; no key). Checked 2026-09-17.

`GET /posting-api/job-board/{board}` returns every listed job with its full ad, publication
time, location, country and employment type in one answer. Answers can be large (several MB
for companies with hundreds of jobs), so the directory only lists companies worth it.
