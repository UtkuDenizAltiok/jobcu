"""d.vinci career sites, through d.vinci's Job Publication API ("since ATS version 2022.11 the
job publication api is always public"; documented for job aggregators among others). Checked
2026-09-24.

`GET https://{board}.dvinci-hr.com/jobPublication/list.json` returns every published job with
its ad in parts (introduction, tasks, profile, offer), its places with coordinates and country
code, the working time and the contract period. d.vinci is common with German hospitals,
councils and mid-sized employers.

The publication's own start date is often empty, so a job's date is when its opening was
created: an "always open" post from years ago is then honestly old.

d.vinci's smaller product serves the same list from `{company}.dvinci-easy.com` (MTU Aero
Engines' portal, with eMoSys and 3D.aero, 2026-09-30); such a board is written as its full host.
