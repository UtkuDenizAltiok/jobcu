"""Adzuna: an official job search API with a free key (Application ID + Application Key).

Free keys allow 25 requests a minute, 250 a day and 2,500 a month, so every request must bring
related ads (SOURCES.md: one general word once brought 6,459 ads in three days, and the budget
ran out before the precise searches did):
- job titles are searched in the ad's title only, most precise first; a title that contains
  another one's words is already found by it ("Hardware Engineer" finds "Hardware Design
  Engineer"), so it isn't asked for again;
- then the person's specialist words anywhere in the ad: single words together in one request
  ("any of these words"), phrases one by one;
- results come by relevance within the window, and each search gets a fair part of what is left
  of this search's requests, so a broad one reads its best ads instead of the newest noise.

The API gives only the start of each ad (~500 characters). Jobcu doesn't read Adzuna's own job
pages: its firewall and robots.txt refuse Jobcu (docs/SOURCES.md). The full
ad comes from the same job on another site when Jobcu finds one (dedupe.py), and for the jobs
worth it, from the person's AI reading it online (jobplace.py).
