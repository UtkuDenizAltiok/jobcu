"""Matching jobs to the search words and named places on Jobcu's side.

Most sources search by words and places themselves. Some can only list their newest jobs
(JobsIreland.ie, company career systems), so Jobcu reads that list and keeps the jobs that
match here. Matching is generous on purpose: the quick relevance check and scoring decide
what's really relevant, so a job is only left out when nothing in it matches.
