"""SAP SuccessFactors career sites (Career Site Builder), through the sitemap each site
publishes for search engines at `/sitemap.xml`. Checked 2026-09-21.

The sitemap comes in two forms:

- **a job feed** (SAP's own site): RSS with every open job's full ad and its place ("Walldorf,
  DE, 69190"), but no posting date;
- **a list of job pages** (Schaeffler, Festo, SICK, KUKA, ZF and most others):
  `/job/{Town}-{Title}-{postcode}/{id}/`, all with the same "last changed" day.

Either way, the posting date is only on the job's own page (`itemprop="datePosted"`), next to
the place, the title and the full ad. So in a search Jobcu first keeps the jobs whose title
matches the search words (and, in a feed, that are in a country searched), and only opens those
pages. A date read in the last three days comes from what Jobcu remembers.

The usual robots.txt closes `/services/` (where SuccessFactors' own RSS search lives) and allows
the job pages and the sitemap; Jobcu checks each company's robots.txt all the same. Big
companies' sitemaps are large (SAP's feed: 16 MB for about 1,000 jobs), so they aren't kept in
memory after reading.
