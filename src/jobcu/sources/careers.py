"""Company career systems and the employer directory (HANDOVER section 9.3).

Career systems (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday and others) publish each company's job list. They
are usually the original and earliest source of a job, but can't be searched across companies,
so Jobcu ships an **employer directory** (`jobcu/data/employers.json`): employers in the
supported countries and the career system they use. It's general reference data, checked with
`tools/check_employers.py`, never built from anyone's searches. The employers a person's own AI
finds for their kind of work (`employers.py`) are read too; they are remembered only in that
person's data folder.

Each search reads the job lists of the employers that hire in the countries searched, keeps
jobs that are fresh, in those countries and match the search words, and treats the result as
the employer's own ad (the best main link, HANDOVER section 10). One company failing never
stops the others.
