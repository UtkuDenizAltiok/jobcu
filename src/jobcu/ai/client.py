"""The one place where Jobcu asks an AI anything.

Every AI request in Jobcu goes through `AIClient.generate`, which:
- picks the provider and model from the user's settings
- checks the user's monthly limit first
- waits and retries on rate limits and short outages, without losing progress
- sends a few requests at a time for steps with many (`in_parallel`), and only one at a time
  once the provider has said "too many requests"
- drops reasoning settings a model doesn't support
- checks the answer against the expected format, and asks once more if it's wrong
- records the tokens used
