"""Towns and how far apart they are, so "within 50 km" works for sources that give only a name.

Job sources with their own location filter (Adzuna, Reed, the Bundesagentur) do the distance
work themselves. Company career sites and some job boards only say "Garching" or "Ireland,
Limerick", so Jobcu looks the town up in the list it ships (`data/places.csv.gz`, from GeoNames)
and measures the distance itself.

The list holds every town with at least 1,000 inhabitants in the supported countries, so small
villages and company sites are missed; those jobs are kept only when their text names the place
(see `sources/matching.py`). Some job sites give only a postcode ("CB22 4QR", "T12 X70A"), so the
UK's postcode districts and Ireland's Eircode areas are shipped too (`data/postcodes.csv.gz`),
each with a point, and a postcode stands for the town it lies in.
