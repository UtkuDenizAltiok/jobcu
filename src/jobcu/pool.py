"""The jobs of the latest search that the conditions about places decide about.

After a search, the person may correct how Jobcu read their location and apply the corrected
conditions to the jobs already found, without searching again.
For that, Jobcu keeps every job of the latest search that passed the other rules (dates, job
types, remote, countries, Not interested), together with what the search already worked out for
each one: the quick relevance check and the score. Jobs that come back in are checked and scored
then; nothing already worked out is asked of the AI twice.

Only the latest search is kept. It stays on this computer with the rest of the search results.
