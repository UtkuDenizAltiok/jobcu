"""The free rules filter (HANDOVER section 11, step 1): objective facts only, no AI.

A job is left out only when a fact proves it doesn't fit:
- it was marked Not interested before
- it's proven older than "Posted within": by its earliest copy's date, or because Jobcu
  already showed it in a search before that time began (a job posted again looks new)
- its closing date for applications has passed
- the source states a job type the user didn't tick
- the source states it's fully remote and remote jobs are excluded
- the source states a country outside the countries searched
- a location condition the AI checked says this place doesn't fit (for example a town that is
  too small, one the person asked to avoid, or too far from the places a condition measures
  to). A job whose place can't be recognised is kept and shown as "not checked" on its card.

Every left-out job is counted with its reason, for "Search details".
