"""The score check (HANDOVER section 13): does Jobcu's scoring match the person's own judgement?

Every search quietly keeps a few of its real job ads, spread across the whole score range, and a
few of the titles the quick relevance check left out. On the **Score check** screen the person
says what they think of each one: a good fit, okay, or poor, and whether a title was really
unrelated. The answers stay in the data folder, never in the repository.

`tools/score_check.py` then measures Jobcu's scores against those answers, which is how the
scoring prompt, the quick check, the batch size and the reasoning effort get tuned.
