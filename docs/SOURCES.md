# Job sources: facts learned from real tests

What Jobcu knows about each source, verified with real requests (dates are when it was checked).
Update this whenever a source changes or something new is learned. Decisions are in
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Adzuna (`src/jobcu/sources/adzuna.py`), checked 2026-09-17

- **Official API, free key** (Application ID + Application Key), entered in Settings.
- **Limits of a free key:** 25 requests a minute, 250 a day, 1,000 a week, 2,500 a month.
  Jobcu pauses 2.6 s between API requests and counts every request in the `source_requests`
  table (stops at 240 a day and 2,400 a month).
- **Countries:** AT, BE, CH, DE, ES, FR, GB, IT, NL, PL. **Not Ireland**, and no other supported
  country.
- **Query parameters that work:** `what_or` (any of these single words, space-separated),
  `what_phrase` (exact phrase), `what` (all words), `title_only` (all these words in the title,
  checked 2026-09-22), `where` + `distance` (km), `max_days_old` (whole days), `sort_by=date` or
  `relevance`, `results_per_page` up to 50. Every answer carries `count`, the total number of
  matches, so one request with `results_per_page=1` measures a query. Boolean queries like
  `"a" OR "b"` return **0 results**. Adzuna matches word stems: `title_only=Elektronik` also finds
  every "Elektroniker" (3,685 in three days).
- **How much a query brings (DE, 3 days, 2026-09-22):** the owner's single words anywhere
  6,459 ads, the same without "Inbetriebnahme" and "Wechselrichter" 337, `what_phrase`
  "Leistungselektronik" 184, `title_only` "Hardwareentwickler" 38. With titles in the title and
  specific words anywhere, a real 30-request run read 192 ads with 19 requests, 78% related
  (before: ~1,500 ads, ~7% related, budget used up before the precise searches ran).
- **Answers:** exact posting time (`created`, UTC), company, location with coordinates, contract
  type/time, `redirect_url`. The description is only the **first ~500 characters**.
- **Full ads: not read (decided 2026-09-24).** `redirect_url` leads to
  `www.adzuna.<country>/details/<id>` (or `/land/ad/<id>` for town-less ads), which carries
  schema.org JobPosting JSON-LD with the full text, but Adzuna's firewall refuses Jobcu (below).
  The full ad comes from the same job on another site, or from the person's AI reading it online.
- Adzuna's website answered 403 to `robots.txt` and its terms page for Jobcu's User-Agent.
- Adzuna often lists the same job twice under different IDs.
- **Single queries answer 5xx now and then** (503 on 2026-09-23, after Jobcu's three polite
  retries). One failing query leaves the source "partial"; three mean Adzuna is really down.
- **Newer ads without a town (checked 2026-09-22):** in 50 fresh German results, 34 had
  `location.area` `["Deutschland"]`, no coordinates, and a `redirect_url` of the form
  `www.adzuna.de/land/ad/<id>` (not `/details/`); that page answers 403 to Jobcu. Their text
  usually names the place ("am Standort in Wietmarschen-Lohne"), which the quick relevance check
  reads. The other 16 had a full `area` list and coordinates.
- **Adzuna's pages and Jobcu (history):** `/land/ad/<id>` always answered 403; the same ad's
  `/details/<id>` gave the full text (KLA, 1,958 characters instead of 500) on 2026-09-23 at
  21:15, but from 21:50 every page answered CloudFront's 403 "Request blocked", still so at
  2026-09-24 03:20. A bug had also stopped all page reading since search 4 (three `/land/ad/`
  refusals in a row). The API itself is unaffected.
- **How much Adzuna brings (search 8, DE/IE/GB, 72 hours):** 351 of 774 ads; 136 of the 242
  jobs worth scoring came from Adzuna alone; 240 of its 298 jobs gave only "Deutschland" or "UK"
  as the place.
- German locations read "Unterhaching, München (Kreis)": the part marked **(Kreis)** is the
  district around a city, not the city, so `places.locate` uses it only when no town is named
  besides it (found in a real test, 2026-09-21: suburbs passed a "1 million people" condition).
- **Adzuna's own place can be wrong** (search 9, 2026-09-24): TRUMPF's "Entwicklungsingenieur RF
  Power Amplifier Design", in Freiburg im Breisgau on LinkedIn, came as "Freiburg (Elbe), Stade
  (Kreis)"; a TechBiz Global ad in Halle came as "Halle, Holzminden (Kreis)".

## Reed (`src/jobcu/sources/reed.py`), checked 2026-09-17

- **Official API, free key** (the key is the Basic-auth user name, empty password). UK only.
- No published rate limit found; Jobcu pauses 0.5 s and caps itself at 400 requests per search.
- `GET /api/1.0/search`: `keywords`, `locationName`, `distanceFromLocation` (miles),
  `resultsToTake` (max 100), `resultsToSkip`. **No date filter, no date sorting, and `OR` doesn't
  work** (one request per search word, read every page).
- Posting date is **by day** (`date`, dd/mm/yyyy). Search results carry a short description.
- `GET /api/1.0/jobs/{id}`: full description (HTML), `contractType` (Permanent / Contract /
  Temporary), `fullTime`, `partTime`, salaries, `externalUrl` (often the employer's or an
  agency's application page).
- Many Reed ads come from recruitment agencies.
- **The place is often a full UK postcode** (search 9, 2026-09-24): 7 of 31 Reed cards had
  "CB224QR", "S336RR", "NR65DR", "SK102NZ", "BT71JL", "OX281AE" or "BB113BP", which the town list
  can't read, so their conditions "couldn't be checked" and a Reed copy doesn't merge with the
  same job elsewhere. Others give a county ("Herefordshire", "Northamptonshire"). A Belfast job
  (Ernest Gordon Recruitment) came with the place "Ireland".
  Since 2026-09-24 Jobcu reads a postcode as the town it lies in (`places.postcode_town`, from
  GeoNames' postcode districts): "BB113BP" is Burnley, and the card says "BB113BP, near Burnley".

## Bundesagentur für Arbeit, Jobsuche (`src/jobcu/sources/bundesagentur.py`), checked 2026-09-17

- **No official API.** Public endpoint documented by github.com/bundesAPI/jobsuche-api; header
  `X-API-Key: jobboerse-jobsuche` (the public client ID the agency's own website uses). May change
  without notice.
- `GET .../jobsuche-service/pc/v6/jobs`: `was` (one phrase), `wo` + `umkreis` (km),
  `veroeffentlichtseit` (days: 0 = today, 1 = since yesterday), `size` (up to 100), `page`.
  Answer: `ergebnisliste`, `maxErgebnisse`.
- Each result has `referenznummer`, `stellenangebotsTitel`, `firma`, `stellenlokationen` (address
  and coordinates), **`datumErsteVeroeffentlichung`** (first publication date, by day),
  `vertragsdauer` (UNBEFRISTET / BEFRISTET), `arbeitszeitVollzeit`, `stellenangebotsart`
  (ARBEIT, SELBSTAENDIGKEIT, PRAKTIKUM_TRAINEE, AUSBILDUNG).
- `GET .../pc/v4/jobdetails/{base64(referenznummer)}`: full description
  (`stellenangebotsBeschreibung`), `allianzpartnerUrl` (often just the company homepage, so not
  used as a job link). Job page for people: `https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/jobsuche/jobdetail/{ref}`.
- **Also lists jobs abroad** (e.g. Austria): the country comes from `adresse.land` (German names).
- No rate limit found; Jobcu pauses 0.7 s.
- **Finding one job again (checked 2026-09-22):** the `arbeitgeber` filter returns nothing in
  v6 (even `arbeitgeber=Bayernwerk AG`). Search results carry the employer as `firma` and places
  as `stellenlokationen` (`adresse.ort`, `breite`, `laenge`); searching by title and matching
  `firma` found 5 of 42 town-less Adzuna jobs reliably.
- **Sometimes only a state is given**, as the API's code ("BADEN_WUERTTEMBERG",
  "SCHLESWIG_HOLSTEIN"), which cards showed as it came (search 9, 2026-09-24). Since 2026-09-24
  it is shown and matched by the state's name ("Baden-Württemberg").

## JobsIreland.ie (`src/jobcu/sources/jobsireland.py`), checked 2026-09-17

- The Irish public employment service's job board (Department of Social Protection). About
  5,100 open vacancies, roughly 300 new a day; many are care, retail, trades and Community
  Employment (CE) scheme placements, some engineering and technician jobs.
- **No API.** The browse page loads its list from
  `GET /Jobsireland.API/JobsIreland/BrowseJobs?keyWord=&location=&page=N&pageSize=100`
  (also `CareerlevelId`, `vacancyId`, `VacancyTypeId`, `ContractTypeId`, all empty). It answers
  **HTML**, sorted **newest first** by publish time; page size 100 works (the page offers 10–100).
  Each answer takes about 5 s.
- Each job block (`div.job-heading[data-vacancyid]`) has hidden inputs `JobId`, `JobTitle`,
  `Location` (often starts with the employer's name), `StartDate` (publish time, **Irish local
  time without a zone**, e.g. `2026-09-16T14:24:50`), `EndDate` (closing date, as that day at midnight: "2026-11-05T00:00:00"), `VacancyTypeId`
  (0 paid position, 3 CE scheme, 4 apprenticeship, 6 self-employed, 10 WPEP work placement).
  The employer's name is only in the logo's `alt="Logo of …"`, and not always. `ul#longlats li`
  holds `lat;lon;address;title;id;ref`, several per job with several locations. The page also
  carries an empty template block (`#JobId`).
- **Keyword search looks at titles only** ("Azure" found nothing although it was in an ad's
  text), so Jobcu reads the newest pages and matches titles itself.
- Job page `GET /en-US/job-Details?id=N`: full ad in `<pre ng-bind-html="Description | linky">`,
  and a list `ul.job-detail_list` with employer, "39 hours per week", "37000.00 Euro Annually" or
  "30000.00 - 34500.00 Euro Annually", publish and closing dates. **No schema.org JobPosting, no
  permanent/temporary information.**
- **robots.txt allows everything.** Terms: the information "is intended only for use by
  jobseekers searching for suitable employment"; re-publishing or reproducing it needs the
  department's permission. Jobcu only shows jobs to the person searching, on their computer.
- Jobcu pauses 2 s between requests and reads at most 40 list pages per search.
- **The list can come back empty for everything** (2026-09-24, about 22:00 to 22:30 Irish
  time): "No jobs match this search" with `totalCount` 0, on its own browse page too, and
  answers took up to 35 s; earlier the same evening it listed jobs. Since then Jobcu reports an
  empty first page as a site problem instead of "0 jobs". The browse page now calls
  `BrowseJobs/43` with two more parameters (`RemoteOrBlendedJobType`, `NaceCode`); the address
  Jobcu uses, without them, answered the same way.
- **Few engineering jobs** (2026-09-30): its 720 newest jobs (72 hours) were care, trades,
  pharmacy and technician roles, with no electronics or hardware engineering title at all, so
  0 jobs for a hardware engineer is right. Ireland's engineering jobs come from employers' own
  career sites.
- Many JobsIreland jobs also appear on EURES (IDs like `base64("2470780 18")`, 18 = JobsIreland),
  but EURES showed only ~1,970 of its ~5,100 jobs.

## Company career systems (`src/jobcu/sources/careers.py` and one module per system), checked 2026-09-17 and 2026-09-21

Jobcu reads the job lists that companies publish in their career systems. Which companies are
read comes from the **employer directory** (`src/jobcu/data/employers.json`), kept up to date with
`tools/check_employers.py` (one request per company; it records the supported countries each
company had jobs in, and whether it also hires outside them).

| System | Address Jobcu reads | What it gives | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Greenhouse | `GET boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{board}/jobs`, full ad from `…/jobs/{id}` | title, location text, `first_published` (exact), `absolute_url` | Public Job Board API. robots.txt allows everything but `/embed/`. EU boards (`job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io`) are served by the same API host. The list has no ad text, so full ads are read per job. |
| Lever | `GET api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json` (EU: `api.eu.lever.co`) | full ad, `createdAt` (exact), **`country`** code, `workplaceType`, `commitment` | Public Postings API; robots.txt asks for 1 s between requests. One country code even for jobs in several places, so it's only trusted for single-place jobs. |
| Ashby | `GET api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/{board}` | full ad, `publishedAt`, location plus `addressCountry`, `employmentType`, `workplaceType` | Public Job Postings API. Answers can be several MB for big companies. |
| Workable | `GET apply.workable.com/api/v1/widget/accounts/{board}`, full ad from `…/api/v2/accounts/{board}/jobs/{shortcode}` | title, city and country code, `published_on` (**day only**), `employment_type`, `telecommuting` | Public widget API; robots.txt allows everything. |
| Recruitee | `GET {board}.recruitee.com/api/offers/` | full ad, `published_at` (exact), places with `country_code`, `employment_type_code`, remote/hybrid | Public Careers Site API. Each company has its own address, so several are read at once. |
| SuccessFactors (added 2026-09-21) | `GET {host}/sitemap.xml`, then the job's page `{host}/job/…/{id}/` | Either an RSS job feed (SAP: full ad, place "Walldorf, DE, 69190", **no date**) or a sitemap of job addresses `/job/{Town}-{Title}-{postcode}/{id}/` (Schaeffler, Festo, SICK, KUKA, MTU, ZF and most others; every entry has the same `lastmod`). The job page carries `itemprop` data: `datePosted` ("Wed Sep 09 02:00:00 UTC 2026"), `streetAddress` ("Bühl, DE, 77815"), `title`, `hiringOrganization`, `description` | SAP's Career Site Builder. robots.txt normally closes `/services/` (SuccessFactors' own RSS search, so it isn't used) and allows the sitemap and job pages; Jobcu checks each company's robots.txt anyway. In a search only the pages whose title matches the search words are opened (Schaeffler: 3 requests in a live test). SAP's feed is 16 MB. Hitachi Energy's and Lenze's sitemaps weren't job lists. **Only sites whose job pages carry the date, place and ad text are in the directory** (SAP, Schaeffler, ZF, KUKA, Festo, Endress+Hauser). Danfoss, SICK, Vitesco and Wacker pages show only the title (the rest needs JavaScript), and MTU's job pages redirect elsewhere: left out for now. |
| Teamtailor (added 2026-09-21) | `GET {board}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`, or `{own domain}/jobs.rss` for companies with their own career-site address | RSS: full ad (HTML), `pubDate` (exact, with zone), `remoteStatus` (`none`/`onsite`, `hybrid`, `fully`, `temporary`), `tt:locations` with city and English country name, department, role | Every Teamtailor career site publishes this feed. robots.txt allows it for every crawler (only `/app/`, `/messages/`, `/jobs/internal/` and one AI crawler are closed) and declares `ai-train=no, ai-input=yes`: Jobcu doesn't train anything. No job type in the feed. Popular in Sweden, Norway, the UK and Ireland. |
| d.vinci (added 2026-09-24) | `GET {board}.dvinci-hr.com/jobPublication/list.json` | `position`, `jobPublicationURL`, the ad in parts (`introduction`, `tasks`, `profile`, `weOffer`, `closingText`, HTML), `jobOpening` with `createdDate`, `locations` (name, coordinates, `country.isoA2`), `workingTimes` (`FULL_TIME`, `PART_TIME`), `contractPeriod` (`UNLIMITED` = permanent), `type`; `startDate` usually empty | Public "since ATS version 2022.11", documented for aggregators. The full list is about 12 KB a job (550 KB for 46). Used by German hospitals and mid-sized employers, also abroad. In the directory since 2026-09-24: Klinikum Neumarkt (45 jobs), Kreiskliniken Reutlingen (55), INVERTO (in ten countries). Customers are found with web searches for `dvinci-hr.com`. |
| Eightfold (added 2026-09-24) | `GET {host}/careers/sitemap.xml?domain={domain}`, then the job's page `{host}/careers/job/{id}-{title and place words}?domain={domain}` | The sitemap lists every open job with `lastmod`; the address carries the title and place words; the page carries **JobPosting** with the exact `datePosted`, the place, the full ad (about 3,400 characters) and `validThrough` | Used by Infineon (jobs.infineon.com), Qualcomm (careers.qualcomm.com), Ericsson (jobs.ericsson.com), Vodafone (jobs.vodafone.com) and Micron (careers.micron.com); the `domain` value is in each site's robots.txt. **robots.txt** starts with `Disallow: /` and then allows `/careers`, `/api/apply`, `/api/pcsx` for every crawler; the old `/api/apply/v2/jobs` answers 403 "Not authorized for PCSX", so Jobcu uses the sitemap and pages. Pages are heavy (about 280 KB), so only recent jobs whose address matches the search words are opened. In the directory (2026-09-24): Infineon (DE 148, AT 88, IE 13, GB 6…), Qualcomm (IE 68, GB 23, DE 20…), Vodafone (DE 462, GB 120, IE 16…), Ericsson (SE 103, DE 7…). |
| prospective.ch (added 2026-09-24) | `GET ohws.prospective.ch/public/v1/medium/{board}/jobs?lang=de&offset=N&limit=100` (the board is the employer's career-centre number, as in `/public/v1/careercenter/{board}/`) | title, `start_date` (exact publication), the ad's parts in `szas` (`sza_tasks`, `sza_requirements`, `sza_benefits`, `sza_company_profil`), `sza_location.city`/`.country`/`.zip`, `sza_pensum.min`/`.max` (workload in %), `links.directlink` (the employer's own job page) | A Swiss system. No key; robots.txt allows everything. Not sorted by date, so every page is read (the federal administration: 5 pages). Some employers give no place at all (University Hospital Basel), so a job without one counts as Swiss. Career-centre numbers are found with web searches for `ohws.prospective.ch/public/v1/careercenter`; some numbers answer 400 (CSS, Kanton Bern, Kanton St. Gallen, HSG, SV Group: their job lists live under another number). In the directory since 2026-09-24: the federal administration (454 jobs), Stadler Rail (362, also in DE, PL, CZ, AT, NL…), University Hospital Basel (128), University of Zurich (126), Canton Basel-Landschaft (66), EKZ (63), ZHAW (25), EMS-Chemie (16). |
| Oracle Recruiting Cloud (added 2026-09-30) | `GET {host}/hcmRestApi/resources/latest/recruitingCEJobRequisitions?onlyData=true&expand=requisitionList.secondaryLocations&finder=findReqs;siteNumber={site},limit=100,offset=N,sortBy=POSTING_DATES_DESC`, full ad from `…/recruitingCEJobRequisitionDetails?expand=all&onlyData=true&finder=ById;Id="{id}",siteNumber={site}` | Newest first: `Title`, `PostedDate` (day), `PrimaryLocation` and **`PrimaryLocationCountry`** (ISO code), `secondaryLocations` with `CountryCode`, `TotalJobsCount`; the job's record has the ad in parts (`ExternalDescriptionStr`, `…ResponsibilitiesStr`, `…QualificationsStr`, HTML), `ExternalPostedStartDate` (exact) and `JobSchedule` ("Full time") | The address Oracle's own career page ("Candidate Experience") loads, no key. The hosts checked (`*.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com`) have no robots.txt; Jobcu asks each time. Pages of 200 work; Jobcu asks for 100 and stops at the first job older than the window (onsemi: 42 fresh jobs in 2 requests). The board is "host/site": Texas Instruments `edbz.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/CX` (careers.ti.com; DE 36, Freising, Munich, Stuttgart), onsemi `hctz.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/CX_1001` (DE 8, IE 11: Munich, Cork, Limerick), Vertiv `egup.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/CX` (IE 30, GB 20: Letterkenny, Derry, London); also Nokia, Arcadis (GB 208, DE 87, IE 15), ArcelorMittal (DE 83), Heathrow, Akamai and Oracle itself. Found with web searches for `oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience`. JPMorganChase's host closes the list in robots.txt: not read. |
| Workday | `POST {host}/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}/jobs` with `{"appliedFacets": …, "limit": 20, "offset": N, "searchText": ""}`, full ad from `GET {host}/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}{externalPath}` | title, `locationsText`, **relative** date ("Posted Today", "Posted 3 Days Ago", "Posted 30+ Days Ago"); the full ad has `startDate` (day), `timeType`, `remoteType` | Not documented, so Jobcu reads each site's robots.txt first and skips the company if it disallows these addresses. Newest first, 20 per page. The answer's filters give each country an ID, so Jobcu asks per searched country. |

- **Reading robots.txt the standard way (2026-09-24):** Python's own reader takes the first
  matching rule, so a file that starts with `Disallow: /` and then allows `/careers` (Eightfold)
  shut Jobcu out of pages the site allows. Jobcu now follows RFC 9309 (`http.RobotsRules`): the
  group for its own name or else for every robot, the longest matching rule, Allow winning a tie,
  `*` and `$` in paths. Workday and SuccessFactors checks use the same reader, so companies they
  had skipped for this reason may now be read.
- **Added 2026-09-30, after search 10's coverage list:** Boston Scientific on SuccessFactors
  (`jobs.bostonscientific.com`: IE 19, DE 11, GB 7; Clonmel, Cork, Galway), Cirrus Logic on
  Lever's EU servers (`eu/cirrus`: GB 36, Edinburgh, London, Newbury), and the three Oracle
  employers above. Seen and not read: Ricardo (`cms.ricardo.com/careers/vacancies`, its own
  pages), EDAG (its own `/career/vacancies`), Keysight (`jobsearch.keysight.com`), AMD
  (`careers.amd.com`).
- **Career systems checked on 2026-09-30, from what the employer finder saw in use:**
  - **SmartRecruiters** (Bosch and others): the public Posting API
    (`api.smartrecruiters.com/v1/companies/{company}/postings`, 721 Bosch jobs in Germany) has a
    robots.txt that allows only `LinkedInBot` and says `Disallow: /` to every other robot.
    **Not read** (hard rule 1).
  - **iCIMS** (AMD, Ricardo, TT Electronics, Schneider Electric): `careers-{company}.icims.com`
    answers `Disallow: /` for every robot. **Not read.**
  - **Avature** (Siemens): robots.txt allows `/externaljobs` pages, but the sitemap lists only
    portal pages, not jobs; the job list is a search page with site-specific filters (20 a page).
    Parked: Siemens' German jobs also reach Jobcu through the Bundesagentur.
  - **Personio** (eMoSys and many German mid-sized employers): the career site
    `{company}.jobs.personio.de` has no robots.txt (404); the old public XML feed (`/xml`)
    answers 404 for eMoSys. **Read since 2026-09-30** (`personio.py`): `GET /search.json` lists
    every job (`id`, `name`, `employment_type` "Festanstellung", `schedule` "Vollzeit",
    `offices`, `department`), without date or ad; the job page `/job/{id}` is plain HTML with
    the full ad and `published_at` (and `created_at`) in its page data. Only pages of jobs whose
    title matches the search words are opened, and remembered for a few days. eMoSys (9 jobs,
    Starnberg) is in the directory.
  - **Softgarden** (PULS, Groupe Eldora): robots.txt closes `/api/`, `/rest/`, `/apply/` and
    `/*/widgets/`, and leaves the list and job pages open. **Read since 2026-09-30**
    (`softgarden.py`): `GET {company}.softgarden.io/de/vacancies` is plain HTML, one block per
    job (`div.matchElement#job_id_{id}`) with the posting day ("01.09.26"), the title linking to
    `/job/{id}/{words}`, the audience ("Berufserfahrene", "Student/in"), the category and the
    towns; the job page carries JobPosting data (full ad, exact `datePosted`, place, company,
    `validThrough`). PULS (9 jobs: Munich, Bad Lobenstein, Freiburg) is in the directory. Not
    seen yet: whether big employers' list pages show every job or only the first ones.
  - **d.vinci's smaller product** serves the same public list from
    `{company}.dvinci-easy.com/jobPublication/list.json` (robots.txt allows all): read since
    2026-09-30, board written as the full host. MTU Aero Engines' portal (19 jobs: eMoSys in
    Starnberg and 3D.aero in Hamburg) is in the directory.
- **A sweep of engineering and energy employers, 2026-10-03** (about 230 careers pages and
  likely job hosts in Germany, the UK and Ireland, Jobcu's own recognition, robots.txt
  respected). Most corporate careers pages show no career system: the job search is one level
  deeper, loaded by script, or on its own host (`jobs.{company}.com`, `careers.{company}.com`),
  and 28 corporate sites refuse robots altogether (Webasto, SMA, STMicroelectronics,
  Fraunhofer, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Microchip, National Grid, Dell…). **Added to the directory
  (18):** on SuccessFactors Rohde & Schwarz (`job.rohde-schwarz.com`, DE 388), Hensoldt
  (`jobs.hensoldt.net`, DE 1,020), Volkswagen Group (`jobs.volkswagen-group.com`, DE 356),
  B. Braun (DE 360), Voith (DE 169), Nordex (`jobs.nordex-online.com`, DE 144), TE Connectivity
  (`careers.te.com`, DE 144, GB 133, IE 15), Everllence, formerly MAN Energy Solutions (DE 110),
  RWE (DE 58, GB 52), Vitesco Technologies, Dana, Jaguar Land Rover (GB 16), Sennheiser; on
  Workday KION Group (DE 144, GB 91); on Eightfold Eaton and Tektronix (Ralliant); ADS-TEC
  Energy on d.vinci; Lotus on Teamtailor. Bentley Motors (SuccessFactors) had no job in a
  supported country. **Seen and not read:** Avature (Siemens, Siemens Energy, Synopsys), iCIMS
  (Schneider Electric, Arm, AMD, Rivian, Wolfspeed), Phenom (ABB, Honeywell, Siemens
  Healthineers), SmartRecruiters (Bosch, Renesas, XP Power, Smiths), Jobvite (Power
  Integrations, Tyndall), SuccessFactors' shared career pages (`career2/career5.successfactors.eu`:
  Brose, IAV, Volkswagen's older site), HR4YOU (Rheinmetall), rexx (Preh), softgarden's `.de`
  pages (Elmos).
- **The employer finder's deeper look on the same list (2026-10-03):** following each careers
  page's job link and trying `jobs.`/`careers.`/`job.` hosts recognised 33 readable job sites
  among the 156 employers (11 before) and left 103 unrecognised (132 before). **Added (17, all
  SuccessFactors):** Fraunhofer (`jobs.fraunhofer.de`, DE 764), Liebherr (DE 508, GB 47, IE 12),
  EDAG (DE 138), MAHLE (DE 133), QinetiQ (GB 121), Vaillant (DE 107), Knorr-Bremse (DE 99, GB 36),
  Alstom (DE 65), HARTING (DE 61, GB 30), Brose (`job.brose.com`, DE 56), Excelitas (DE 56),
  Danfoss (`jobs.danfoss.com`, DE 50; its job pages now show their dates), Oxford Instruments
  (GB 44), ESB (IE 43), PowerCo, Murata, sonnen.
- **Avature, looked at again (2026-10-03):** `jobs.siemens.com/en_US/externaljobs/SearchJobs/{words}`
  is allowed by robots.txt and offers an RSS feed (`…/feed/`) with title, link and `pubDate`,
  but no place, not newest first, and the job pages carry no JobPosting data: reading it means
  parsing each Avature site's own page layout. Still parked.
- **Job sitemaps with JobPosting pages (2026-10-03; read since then, `sitemaps.py`):** some
  recruiters and employers publish a
  sitemap of every job page (with `lastmod`) and put schema.org JobPosting data on each page
  (exact `datePosted`, place, full ad). Checked: **Redline Group** (`/sitemap_jobs.xml`, 245
  jobs, `/job-details/…`; its terms have no clause on automated access), **ECM Selection**
  (`/sitemap.xml`, `/jobs/{id}/{title}`; terms forbid copying only "for commercial gain"; its
  pages write the script type as `application/ld&#x2B;json`), **expertum** (`/job/sitemap.xml`,
  no `lastmod`; its AGB cover staffing contracts, not the website). **Not usable by their
  terms:** Hays (hays.de, 4,471 jobs in `job-sitemap.xml`; Nutzungsbedingungen I.3: "Kein
  Sammeln oder Auslesen von Informationen oder Daten aus den Services"), Rise Technical ("You
  may not copy, download, reproduce, re-sell or publish any part of the website"). Michael
  Page's sitemap lists advice pages, not jobs. Employers with job sitemaps but no JobPosting on
  the pages: Cambridge Consultants (`cambridgeconsult_job-sitemap.xml`, 88).
  Redline's sitemap dates every page with the day it was made, so its dates don't narrow
  anything; 40 of its 246 addresses matched the owner's search words (2026-10-03). In the
  directory: Redline Group (GB), ECM Selection (GB), expertum (DE).
- Other career systems seen on engineering employers' sites (2026-09-24, not built): **Avature**
  (jobs.siemens.com, jobs.siemens-energy.com, jobs.lenovo.com: "Allow: /$ # Disallowed portals
  are included as…"), Rohde & Schwarz's own jobboard (job.rohde-schwarz.com), Renesas
  (jobs.renesas.com, which closes `/jobs?*`), Arm (careers.arm.com, which closes
  `/search-jobs/`), Bosch (jobs.bosch.com closes `/en/`); Bayer runs SuccessFactors.
- **Employers behind fresh fitting jobs Jobcu missed** (the owner's coverage list, 2026-09-24):
  Moog runs **Workday** (`moog.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/MOOG_External_Career_Site`, power electronics
  and servo drives in Carrigaline, Cork); Tektronix posts on `careers.ralliant.com`, Nordex on
  `jobs.nordex-online.com`, ASSA ABLOY on `assaabloy.com/career`; Advanced Energy, Vishay, Ei
  Electronics, Cambridge Consultants, Saab, Luxinar and COMPACT DYNAMICS not checked yet. Robots
  and terms of each still to be read before adding them.
- **Added 2026-09-24 (night), Workday, for engineering in Ireland, the UK and Germany:** Moog
  (IE 14, GB 27, DE 18), Microchip (DE 24, GB 13, IE 9), Flex (GB 20, IE 14, DE 10), Hitachi
  including Hitachi Energy (DE 195, GB 109, IE 18), AtkinsRéalis (GB 713, IE 49), Carrier
  (DE 147, GB 28), Valeo (DE 54, IE 9), Magna (DE 89, GB 12, IE 5), Spectris's HBK, Servomex
  and Malvern Panalytical, Rockwell Automation, Trimble, Cognex, Viavi, Sensata and Nidec
  (counts: jobs when checked). Stryker's missed Cork job (the coverage list) was posted 9 days
  earlier on its own site: LinkedIn showed a newer date, so it was rightly outside 72 hours.
- **Some Workday sites have no country filter** (GE Vernova, 2026-09-30): Jobcu reads the
  whole worldwide list (340 jobs in 72 hours, 18 requests) and gets each job's country from
  its place alone, often just a town ("Rugby", "Stafford", "Berlin").
- **A Workday site answering 422 is a wrong site name**, or a site that moved (Dell's own
  `External` page answers 500): 30 guessed sites answered this way (AMD, Dell, Keysight, onsemi,
  TE Connectivity, Honeywell, Schneider Electric, Zeiss, Continental…). Their real addresses are
  still to be found. Siemens Healthineers' and Western Digital's robots.txt close the job list.
- **Eightfold's 0 jobs in search 9 was real:** Infineon's sitemap (1,311 jobs) had 35 changed in
  the 72 hours, 2 of them in Germany (a working student in Regensburg, a planning job in Dresden).
- **Some Workday sites repeat their first page for every offset** (2026-09-24 night: 25 copies
  of the same titles), so Jobcu stops a list at the first page with nothing new.
- **Rolls-Royce's Workday entry** is named "Rolls-Royce (professional)" (the site's name), and its
  jobs came without a town, so they never merged with the same jobs on Adzuna (search 9).
- **Finding SuccessFactors sites** (2026-09-21): their robots.txt has the tell-tale
  `Disallow: /services/`, `/applybutton/`, `/talentcommunity/` lines. Probing `jobs.{company}.com`
  for 50 big German engineering employers found 13; `check_employers.py --only-new` kept 11,
  of which 6 have job pages with full data.
- **Finding employers for the directory** (2026-09-21): web searches such as
  `site:teamtailor.com jobs Dublin engineer` give a handful of companies each. Teamtailor links in
  Arbetsförmedlingen's open data are mostly Swedish care and service employers whose ads Jobcu
  already gets from Arbetsförmedlingen, so they weren't added.
- **SmartRecruiters is not used:** `api.smartrecruiters.com/robots.txt` allows only LinkedIn's
  crawler and disallows everyone else, although the Posting API itself is public.
- **Personio is not used yet:** the XML feed (`{company}.jobs.personio.de/xml`) is empty unless the
  company switches it on (checked on several companies), and the career pages need JavaScript.
  Many Personio jobs arrive through Arbeitnow instead.
- Career-system jobs count as the **employer's own ad**, so they win the main link (HANDOVER §10).

## Arbeitnow (`src/jobcu/sources/arbeitnow.py`), checked 2026-09-17

- **Free public API, no key:** `GET https://www.arbeitnow.com/api/job-board-api?page=N` (Germany
  and neighbours, 250 jobs a page) and `https://www.arbeitnow.co.uk/api/job-board-api` (UK, 100 a
  page). Jobs come **newest first** with `created_at` (exact), the **full ad text**, company,
  free-text location, `job_types`, `remote` and a link to the job's page there.
- **Some descriptions arrive with their HTML escaped** (`&lt;p&gt;`), so after conversion the text
  still holds literal tags (Graphcore's ad, kept for the score check, 2026-09-24). Since
  2026-09-24 `text.html_to_text` unescapes it first.
- Its jobs come mostly from career systems (Greenhouse, SmartRecruiters, JOIN, Teamtailor,
  Recruitee, Personio), so it reaches many German and British companies Jobcu has no directory
  entry for. About 200 new jobs a day on the German list.
- Terms: free to use, "please do not abuse", and a link back to Arbeitnow, which Jobcu's job link
  provides. robots.txt allows everything.
- Locations are free text ("Berlin", "London, Greater London, United Kingdom", "Remote - EMEA"),
  so the country comes from `placenames.py`.

## jobs.ac.uk (`src/jobcu/sources/jobsacuk.py`), checked 2026-09-17

- Universities, research institutes and related employers, mostly in the UK and Ireland: a kind of
  job Jobcu's other sources barely carry (research, technical and academic posts).
- **No API.** `GET /search/?keywords=…&sortOrder=1&pageSize=25&startIndex=N` gives HTML with the
  jobs **newest first** (`sortOrder=1`; 0 is relevance, 2 is closing date). Each result has the
  job's link (`/job/{ID}/{slug}`), title, department, employer, location, salary and
  "Date Placed: 27 Aug" (day and month, no year).
- Each job's own page carries **schema.org JobPosting**, so `jobposting.py` gives the full ad,
  the exact date, the employment type and remote status.
- **robots.txt** allows everything except `/job/feedback/` and `/enhanced/fp/`. The terms say
  material may be downloaded, printed and copied "for your own personal use" and not re-published,
  which is what Jobcu does.
- Jobcu pauses 1.5 s, reads at most 4 pages per search word, and stops when a page has only jobs
  older than the window. A real check (UK and Ireland, 72 hours, 4 search words): **156 jobs in 11
  requests, 16 seconds**.
- Some ads are outside the supported countries (Dubai, Hong Kong); the country comes from the
  location text through `placenames.py`. Jobcu only asks jobs.ac.uk when the UK or Ireland is
  searched: it lists a few jobs elsewhere in Europe, but not enough to spend requests on.

## EURAXESS (`src/jobcu/sources/euraxess.py`), checked 2026-09-17

- The European Commission's researcher portal: research jobs, PhD and postdoc positions at
  universities, institutes and research-heavy companies in every supported country (about 6,900
  open offers).
- **No API.** `GET /jobs/search?keywords=…&sort[name]=created&sort[direction]=DESC&page=N` gives
  HTML, 10 results a page, newest first. Each result has the country as a label, the organisation,
  "Posted on: 17 September 2026", the title with `/jobs/{id}`, a summary and the work locations.
- Job pages carry **no** schema.org JobPosting, so the full ad is read with `trafilatura`; the
  page also states "Type of Contract" and "Job Status", which give the job type.
- **robots.txt allows `/jobs/search`.** No rule against automated reading was found, and the
  Commission's legal notice allows reuse of its content with the source named. (This is different
  from EURES, whose "Find a job" terms allow extraction only for EURES partner organisations.)
  Jobcu pauses 2 s and stops as soon as a page has nothing inside the time window.
- A real check (Ireland, UK and Germany, 72 hours, 3 search words): 5 jobs in 9 requests, 18 s.
- **It asks Jobcu to slow down** when a search uses many words (a German search with 20 words got
  "429" after about 50 requests). Jobcu now pauses 4 s, uses the field words first (research ads
  are described by field, not job title), reads at most 12 words and 2 pages each, and stops at
  25 requests per search.

## Arbetsförmedlingen, Sweden (`src/jobcu/sources/jobtech.py`), checked 2026-09-21

- **Sweden's public employment service**, through its open **JobSearch API** (JobTech):
  `GET https://jobsearch.api.jobtechdev.se/search`. All ads in Platsbanken, Sweden's national
  job board, with the **full ad text**. Data licence **CC0**, **no key or registration**, no
  robots.txt, no stated rate limit (data.arbetsformedlingen.se/dataservice/jobsearch).
- Parameters used: `published-after` (minutes back, or a datetime), `published-before`,
  `sort=pubdate-desc`, `limit` (at most 100), `offset` (**at most 2,000**). Older ads are reached
  by asking again with `published-before` set to the oldest ad seen. The `X-Fields` header asks
  only for the fields Jobcu uses (0.55 MB per 100 ads instead of 1.3 MB).
- **About 1,600 new ads a day** (10,900 in a week, counted on 2026-09-21). A 24-hour search is
  about 16 requests; a week about 110.
- **Why Jobcu reads the whole window instead of using `q`:** the default "smart" free-text search
  treats "hardware engineer" as one occupation (2 hits in a week, against 18 with
  `x-feature-disable-smart-freetext: true` and `x-feature-freetext-bool-method: and`), and word
  search doesn't look inside Swedish compound words ("kraftelektronik" isn't found by
  "elektronik"). Jobcu's own matching finds words inside longer words.
- `publication_date` is **Swedish local time** without a zone. `workplace_address` gives city,
  municipality, county (`län`) and `coordinates` as **[longitude, latitude]** (about 96% have
  them). The distance filter `position` + `position.radius` returned nothing in a test, so Jobcu
  matches places itself. Ads abroad (country other than "Sverige") are skipped.
- Job types: `employment_type` "Tillsvidareanställning" = permanent; "Vanlig anställning" depends
  on `duration` ("Tills vidare" = permanent, a period = fixed-term); "Tidsbegränsad",
  "Säsongsanställning", "Sommarjobb" = fixed-term; "Behovsanställning" (called in when needed) =
  part-time; `working_hours_type` "Deltid" adds part-time.
- `application_details.url` mostly leads to the employer's own application system (Varbi,
  ReachMee, Visma Recruit, Teamtailor, Recruitee), so it is used as the employer's link.
- A real check (24 hours, 12 electronics search words): 3 jobs in 17 requests, 10 s.

## service.bund.de, Germany's public sector (`src/jobcu/sources/servicebund.py`), checked 2026-09-24

The federal job portal (Bundesverwaltungsamt) for federal, state and municipal employers,
universities, research institutes, courts, prisons and the armed forces' civilian jobs:
administration, social work, law, trades (electricians, painters, chimney sweeps),
housekeeping, research, engineering.

- **An open RSS feed:** `GET https://www.service.bund.de/Content/Globals/Functions/RSSFeed/
  RSSGenerator_Stellen.xml` gives the **newest 500 jobs** (348 KB), about **2.5 days** on a
  weekday (203 on 22 September, 237 on 23 September), so a 24- or 48-hour search is covered in
  one request. Each item: title, link (with `#track=feed-jobs`, which Jobcu drops), `pubDate`
  (with zone; 22 of 500 at exactly midnight, which Jobcu treats as "day known only"), and in the
  description, as escaped HTML inside CDATA ("Universit&#228;t"): the employer
  ("Arbeitgeber"), the place ("Ort: 65173 Wiesbaden"; a five-digit postcode means Germany) and
  the closing date ("Bewerbungsfrist"). No filter parameters. The site offers the feed for RSS
  readers, "ohne Registrierung". Separate feeds exist for training places
  (`RSSGenerator_Ausbildungsplaetze.xml`, not read).
- **Job pages** (`/IMPORTE/Stellenangebote/editor/{employer}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{id}.html`): the full ad
  between the comments `<!--Tätigkeit einfügen-->` and `<!--Tätigkeit ende-->` (Tätigkeitsprofil,
  Anforderungsprofil); a `section.shortlist` list with Tätigkeitsfeld, Ort (plus a "Karte
  anschauen" link), **Arbeitszeit** (Vollzeit/Teilzeit), **Anstellungsdauer**
  (Unbefristet/Befristet), Bewerbungsfrist and "Laufbahn / Entgeltgruppe" (a pay grade such as
  "E 13 TVöD", or a career track such as "Mittlerer Dienst"); coordinates in
  `#location-map[data-lat][data-lon]`; often a link "Stellenangebot (HTML-Seite)" to the
  employer's own application system, and a PDF. **No schema.org JobPosting.**
- **robots.txt** closes only the search pages (`/Content/DE/Stellen/Suche/`) and
  `/SiteGlobals/`, and asks for **`Crawl-delay: 30`**. Jobcu waits 30 s between requests and
  reads at most 12 job pages per search (six minutes); the other jobs keep their summary and are
  read online by the person's AI when they score 50 or more.
- **Terms (Impressum):** the texts' copyright stays with the advertising body, and the portal's
  content may not be reproduced, distributed or exhibited without consent. Reading the feed and
  showing a job to the one person searching, on their computer, is what an RSS reader does.
- **Overlap with the Bundesagentur (sample of 25, title and town search, employer matched):**
  8 found there, 17 not (a ministry's clerk, a county's maintenance clerk, a city's tax clerk,
  two chimney-sweep districts, a prison archive, a Helmholtz postdoc). So about **two thirds of
  its jobs are new** to Jobcu, some 150 a day.
- **Live run (2026-09-24, a made-up social worker, 24 hours):** 5 matching jobs from the feed in
  1.3 s (Berlin, Lage, Herne); two full ads read 30 s apart (about 5,000 characters each, both
  fixed-term and part-time).

## Teaching Vacancies, England's schools (`src/jobcu/sources/teachingvacancies.py`), checked 2026-09-24

The Department for Education's service for jobs in England's schools: teachers, teaching
assistants, school leaders, office, catering, cleaning and site staff.

- **An official open API:** `GET https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/api/v1/jobs.json?page=N`,
  no key, 100 jobs a page, **strictly newest first** (800 checked, none out of order;
  `meta.count` 6,847 live jobs, `meta.totalPages` 69; about 230 posted by midday on a weekday).
  Every job is **schema.org JobPosting**: `title`, `datePosted` (day), `description` (HTML, the
  ad's first part: 194 to 10,236 characters, median about 2,300), `employmentType`
  (`FULL_TIME`, `PART_TIME`, with `TEMPORARY` for fixed-term contracts), `jobLocation` (one or a
  list, with street, town, region, postcode and `addressCountry` GB), `hiringOrganization`
  (`sameAs` is the school's website, not the job), `validThrough` (closing time),
  `occupationalCategory` (teacher, teaching_assistant, other_support,
  administration_hr_data_and_finance, catering_cleaning_and_site_management…), `url`.
- **Job pages** (`/jobs/{slug}`) carry much more than the API's text: **visa sponsorship**
  ("Visas cannot be sponsored"), key stage and subject, working pattern, **contract type**, pay
  scale, start date, closing date, what the school offers and the safeguarding checks (a short
  ad went from 264 to 3,629 characters). Their JobPosting data holds only the API's text, so
  Jobcu reads the page text (trafilatura).
- **Terms for API users:** listings may be reused under the **Open Government Licence**, except
  that no fee may be charged for hiring someone found through them. robots.txt allows everything
  except search pages with parameters (`/*-jobs*?*`, `/jobs*radius=*`), `/documents/`,
  `/attachments/` and account pages.
- Jobcu reads pages until one holds a job older than the window (newest first), at most 30 a
  search. **Live run (2026-09-24, a made-up primary-school teacher, 24 hours):** 48 matching
  jobs in 8 requests (7.6 s; day-only dates reach back to the previous day), job types from the
  API (permanent, part-time, fixed-term); one page read added the visa line (2,184 → 6,222
  characters).

## NHS Jobs, health in England and Wales (`src/jobcu/sources/nhsjobs.py`), checked 2026-09-24

The NHS Business Services Authority's job site: NHS trusts, GP practices, hospices and health
charities in England and Wales (nurses, doctors, pharmacists, porters, clerks, cleaners,
managers).

- **An open XML search feed:** `GET https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/api/v1/search_xml?
  sort=publicationDateDesc&limit=100&page=N` (without `limit` 10 a page; `pageSize` and `size`
  are ignored), also `keyword=…`. `totalResults` 12,712 live jobs; about **1,000 new a day**.
  Each `vacancyDetails`: `id`, `reference`, `title`, a ~150-character `description`, `employer`,
  `type` (Permanent, Fixed-Term, Bank…), `salary` ("£49387.00 to £56515.00"), `closeDate`,
  **`postDate`** (UK time without a zone, with nanoseconds: "2026-09-24T12:18:24.800841778"),
  `url` (on `beta.jobs.nhs.uk`; the same page is on `www.jobs.nhs.uk`), `locations`
  ("Bradford, BD9 6RJ", one or more). `totalPages` at the end. `location=Leeds&distance=10`
  with a keyword returned 0 in one test.
- **Job pages** (`/candidate/jobadvert/{reference}`) carry the whole ad in `<main>`: job summary,
  main duties, about us, job description, the **person specification** (essential and
  desirable qualifications, such as a professional registration), date posted, pay band, salary,
  `p#contract_type` (Permanent, Fixed term, Bank…) and the working pattern after
  `h3#working_pattern_heading` (Full-time, Part-time, Flexible working). The details appear
  twice (a `show-mobile` copy), which Jobcu drops. **No JobPosting data**; trafilatura misses the
  collapsed sections, so Jobcu reads `<main>` itself.
- **No robots.txt** (the address answers an HTML page). **Terms** (Candidate Terms and
  Conditions, 22 July 2025) are about accounts, applications and data protection; nothing about
  automated reading.
- Jobcu reads pages until one holds a job older than the window, at most 40 a search. "Bank"
  counts as part-time (called in when needed), "Permanent" says nothing about hours until the
  page is read. **Live run (2026-09-24, a made-up intensive-care nurse, 24 hours):** 37 jobs in
  10 requests (9.9 s); a page read took one ad from 153 to 7,194 characters with the person
  specification.

## Le Forem's open data, Belgium (`src/jobcu/sources/leforem.py`), checked 2026-09-24

Every job offer Le Forem (Wallonia's public employment service) distributes, as an **open
dataset under CC BY-SA 4.0**, updated in real time (Opendatasoft). Credit is in README.md.

- **Export:** `GET https://leforem-digitalwallonia.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/
  datasets/offres-d-emploi-forem/exports/json?where=datedebutdiffusion>=date'2026-09-23'&
  select=…&order_by=…` returns **every matching offer in one request** (2,056 offers, 1.5 MB,
  1.6 s for two days); the paged `/records` address stops at 10,000 and 100 a page.
- **Volume:** 26,204 live offers; about **1,200 new a day**. Not only Wallonia: 3,656 in
  Flanders (NUTS BE2) and 1,554 in Brussels (BE1), a few in France and Luxembourg. The biggest
  contributors are **Jobat** (10,284), Forem's own site (4,130), staffing agencies (Accent,
  Adecco, Randstad…) and **StepStone Belgium** (402).
- **Each offer:** `numerooffreforem`, `titreoffre`, towns (`lieuxtravaillocalite`, often in
  capitals), region names and NUTS codes (the first is the country), **coordinates**,
  `typecontrat` (in two days: 1,001 "Intérimaire avec option sur durée indéterminée", 535
  "Durée indéterminée", 247 "Intérimaire", 209 "Durée déterminée", then student, flexi-jobs,
  replacement, freelance, civil servant), `regimetravail` (Temps plein / Temps partiel),
  employer, number of posts, education level (ISCED), **languages** (with ISO codes),
  `experiencerequise` (the occupation in which experience is asked), **driving licence**, sector
  (NACE), occupation (`metier`, with its code), `datedebutdiffusion` (day), end of publication,
  source, external reference and the Forem `url`. **No ad text.**
- The Forem job pages (`/recherche-offres/`) are **closed by robots.txt**: Jobcu never opens
  them; the person does, through the job's link. Jobcu turns the structured fields into a short
  summary with English labels (so the scoring doesn't take the ad for a French one), and the
  best jobs are read online by the person's AI, like other summaries.
- **Live run (2026-09-24, made-up Belgian searches, 24 hours):** 68 matching offers from one
  request in 1.5 s: 51 truck drivers, 15 nurses in Wallonia and Brussels, 2 "Verpleegkundige";
  **no primary-school teacher jobs**, so Flemish and Walloon schools post elsewhere (the
  education departments' own portals, still to be found).

## Werken voor Nederland, the Dutch government (`src/jobcu/sources/werkenvoornederland.py`), checked 2026-09-24

The Dutch central government's own job site: ministries, agencies, courts, the tax office
(Belastingdienst), Defence, Rijkswaterstaat and others.

- **Sitemap:** `GET https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/sitemap-vacatures.xml` (about 300 KB)
  lists **1,281** job pages with `lastmod` (the last change, not the posting date): 129 changed
  in 24 hours, 282 in 48, 430 in 72, 540 in a week (2026-09-24). Each address carries the job's
  title and number: `/vacatures/{title words}-{organisation}-{year}-{number}`.
- **Job pages** carry **schema.org JobPosting**: title, `datePosted` (day), `validThrough`
  (day), `employmentType` (mostly TEMPORARY: government jobs often start with a temporary
  contract), `hiringOrganization` (with a leading space), place ("Den Haag (Rijnstraat)",
  "Rijnstraat 8 te Den Haag"), salary range. Its `description` is a one-line summary; the page
  text (trafilatura) has the whole ad (1,300 to 9,000 characters).
- **robots.txt** closes only `/login` and says `Request-rate: 10/1`; Jobcu waits 0.3 s.
  data.overheid.nl lists the jobs as open data too ("Vacatures Overheid", with a CSO vacancy
  API); its page timed out in the check.
- Jobcu matches the search words against the title words of the addresses changed since the
  day before the window, and opens only the matching pages (at most 80 a search). **Live run
  (2026-09-24, deliberately broad words "Beleidsmedewerker", "Jurist", "Adviseur", 72 hours):**
  43 jobs before the 80-page cap, from the Foreign Office, the tax office, a court, Defence.

## NAV Arbeidsplassen, Norway (`src/jobcu/sources/nav.py`), checked 2026-09-24

Norway's public employment service and its job ad database (every kind of work: municipal
care homes, hospitals, shops, trades, offices).

- **The stilling-feed** (navikt.github.io/pam-stilling-feed): `GET https://pam-stilling-feed.nav
  .no/api/v1/feed` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `If-Modified-Since` (RFC 1123), then
  `next_url` page by page (1,000 entries an answer, about 500 KB). Since yesterday noon: **2,394
  new or changed entries in 4 requests**. Each entry: `title`, `businessName`, `municipal`,
  `status` (ACTIVE/INACTIVE), `date_modified`, `uuid`. **An ad changed twice appears twice**, so
  Jobcu reads each `uuid` once.
- **The public token** is served at `/api/publicToken` as text ("Current public token for Nav
  Job Vacancy Feed:" and the token), "for experimentation", rotating at irregular intervals; Jobcu
  fetches it each search. A **private token** is issued on request by e-mail with a name, contact
  and written acceptance of the terms (a question for the owner, PROGRESS.md).
- **Full entry:** `GET /api/v1/feedentry/{uuid}` gives `ad_content`: `title`, `jobtitle`,
  `published` (Norwegian midnight, so a day), `expires`, `updated`, **`applicationDue`**
  ("2026-10-18T00:00:00", or words like "snarest"), `workLocations` (country "NORGE", city,
  municipal, county, postcode), `employer` (name, organisation number, description),
  `engagementtype` (Fast, Vikariat, Engasjement, Sesong, Lærling…), `extent` (Heltid/Deltid),
  **`applicationUrl`** (the employer's own application system), `link` (arbeidsplassen.nav.no),
  `categoryList` (**ESCO**, JANZZ and STYRK-08 occupation codes), `description` (HTML), and
  `contactList` with **names, e-mails and phone numbers** (personal data: Jobcu never keeps it).
- **Terms** (arbeidsplassen.nav.no/vilkar-api): "Alle kan bruke tenesta", free; ads must be
  removed when they become inactive and updated when they change; the apply function must
  deep-link to the original application system (Jobcu's main link is `applicationUrl`);
  Norwegian data protection rules apply to personal data in ads. No stated rate limit; Jobcu
  waits 0.5 s. The old public-feed API was switched off on 1 May 2025.
- **Live run (2026-09-24, a made-up nurse, 24 hours, "Sykepleier" and two variants):** 37
  distinct ads from 54 requests in 29 s (municipal care homes, Oslo University Hospital, a
  school nurse), with closing dates and hours.

## Google Maps, for travel times (`src/jobcu/travel.py`), checked 2026-09-21

Not a job source: used only for conditions like "at most 50 minutes by public transport to a
big city", and only with the user's own key (Settings → Travel times).

- **Routes API, Compute Route Matrix:** `POST routes.googleapis.com/distanceMatrix/v2:
  computeRouteMatrix`, headers `X-Goog-Api-Key` and `X-Goog-FieldMask:
  originIndex,destinationIndex,duration,condition`; origins and destinations as `latLng`;
  `travelMode` TRANSIT / DRIVE / WALK / BICYCLE; `departureTime` for transit and driving (Jobcu:
  next Tuesday 8:00 local time). The answer is a JSON list of elements with `duration` like
  `"1020s"` and `condition` `ROUTE_EXISTS`. **At most 100 elements per request for TRANSIT**
  (625 otherwise). Billed per element (origins × destinations). Jobcu's requests use no
  traffic-aware routing and no two-wheeler mode, so they are billed as Essentials (Pro starts with
  TRAFFIC_AWARE; checked 2026-09-22).
- **Places API is not used** (it was for a short while on 2026-09-21): looking up "{company},
  {town}" can find the wrong site of a company with several, so Jobcu stays with the place the
  job ad gives (the owner's decision).
- **Free monthly allowance (since March 2025, checked 2026-09-21):** Route Matrix Essentials
  10,000 elements, Pro 5,000 (traffic-aware routing, which Jobcu doesn't use); Places Text Search
  Essentials/Pro 5,000; Geocoding 10,000. Above that, about $5 per 1,000 route elements and
  $32 per 1,000 place look-ups. Google requires a billing account even for free use.
- Jobcu counts elements in `source_requests` (`google_maps_routes`) and stops at the monthly
  limit in Settings (9,000 by default), then uses AI estimates.
- **Storing answers (checked 2026-09-22, Maps Service Specific Terms):** for the Routes API,
  section 19.3 allows caching **only latitude and longitude values, for up to 30 days**. Travel
  durations may not be cached (only the Navigation Connect API allows that). So Jobcu keeps
  Google's minutes only inside the search that asked for them; the AI's own estimates are
  remembered for 30 days in `travel_memory`. The same terms (19.1, 19.2) allow using the answers
  without a Google map, but never with a non-Google map.
- The key goes only in a request header, never in an address, so it can't end up in a log.
- **The daily quota is counted in Pacific time (checked 2026-09-23):** searches on the evening
  of 22 September (297 elements) and at 02:00 on 23 September (37) fell in the same Google day
  and passed the 320 quota, which answers 429 "Quota exceeded … Route matrix elements per day".
  The owner's daily quota is now 450 (31 × 450 = 13,950, about $20 above the free 10,000 if
  Jobcu's own monthly stop ever failed, so still inside his €25).
- **Car trips take no departure time (checked 2026-09-22):** with `departureTime` and the default
  routing, Google answers 400 "Timestamp cannot be set for TRAFFIC_UNAWARE routing mode". A time
  would need `routingPreference` TRAFFIC_AWARE, which is billed as Pro. Public transport keeps its
  departure time.
- **First real answer (2026-09-22, the owner's key):** Freising town centre → Munich centre
  (Marienplatz), transit, Tuesday 8:00: 69 minutes. Door to door, so walking at both ends and
  changes are included; the train ride alone is 25–45 minutes.
- **Google-side stops (checked 2026-09-22):** Cloud Billing's spend caps (Preview) pause a
  service once a budget is reached, but only for the Gemini API, Vertex AI (Gemini Enterprise
  Agent Platform), Cloud Run and Cloud Run functions, **not Maps**: a Maps budget can only send
  emails. The Google-side stop for Maps is therefore a daily quota on the Routes API.
- **Setting it up (checked 2026-09-22):** with a European billing address, turning on the Routes
  API first asks to accept the Google Maps Platform EEA Terms of Service (type "Confirm"). For the
  Routes API they add one rule: its route descriptions and steps may not be used "With any Map".
  After enabling, Google creates a key named "Maps Platform API Key" that is allowed 35 Maps APIs;
  restrict it to the Routes API. The quota page (Google Maps Platform → Quotas → Routes API) has
  adjustable daily quotas "DistanceMatrix - ComputeRouteMatrix per-element quota per day" and
  "Directions - ComputeRoutes per request quota per day" (both unlimited by default).
  [EEA adjustments for the Routes API](https://developers.google.com/maps/comms/eea/routes).

## Google Gemini API billing, the owner's AI provider, checked 2026-09-22

Not a job source; recorded because the owner uses it and pays for it.

- **A project with billing turned on gets no free allowance:** every request is charged at paid
  prices, however small. The free tier applies only to projects without billing; a person can
  keep both kinds of project, each with its own key.
- **Prepay:** credits bought in advance in AI Studio (Billing page) are used up in near real
  time. At zero, every request fails with HTTP 402 until more credits are bought, unless
  auto-reload is on (with an optional monthly auto-charge limit).
- **Prices for `gemini-3.8-flash` (checked 2026-09-22):** $0.75 per million input tokens and $3.75
  per million output tokens until 31 December 2026, then $1.50 and $7.50. Grounding with Google
  Search: 5,000 free search queries a month shared by all Gemini 3.x models, then $14 per 1,000,
  billed per query the model runs (one request can run several).
- **Spend caps:** per project, either in AI Studio (Spend page → "Monthly spend cap") or as a
  Cloud Billing budget with "Spend cap enforcement" (one project, one service, monthly; alerts
  fixed at 50%, 80% and 100%). At the cap, the Gemini API is paused until the cap is lifted by
  hand. Since April 2026 every billing account also has a tier-wide monthly cap.
- AI Studio's own "Monthly spend cap" (Spend page) is shown separately: with a spend-cap budget
  set in Cloud Billing, it still shows no cap. One of the two is enough.
- Sources: [Cloud Billing spend caps](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-spend-caps),
  [Gemini API billing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing).

## Job boards on hold: what their terms say (checked 2026-09-18 and 2026-09-21)

Facts for the owner's decision (DECISIONS.md, 2026-09-17: boards stay on hold until the coverage
test shows what Jobcu misses). Nothing is built for them. **All four belong to the Stepstone
Group**, so one written permission could cover them all.

- **robots.txt** of IrishJobs.ie, Jobs.ie, Totaljobs and StepStone.de allows the `/job/` and
  `/jobs/` pages for every crawler (2026-09-18).
- **IrishJobs.ie and Jobs.ie** (The Stepstone Group Ireland Recruit Ltd, same terms): 4.8.1 use
  the site "only … for lawful purposes when seeking employment", and never overload it; 4.8.2 and
  4.8.3 no use of the site or its Content "in competition with our business activities (as
  determined by us at our sole discretion)"; 4.5.2 "our prior written permission is required for
  any such use or removal of the Content"; 16 "Content … can be downloaded for personal
  non-commercial use". **No clause names robots, crawling or scraping.**
- **Totaljobs** (The Stepstone Group UK Ltd): 1.1 the site is "for the sole purpose of individuals
  looking for employment opportunities"; people "may use, print and download information from the
  site for these purposes only" and may not otherwise copy, transmit or distribute it; any other
  "unauthorised processing" is a material breach. **No clause names robots or scraping.**
- **StepStone.de** (The Stepstone Group GmbH, terms of 06.11.2025, a PDF linked from
  /e-recruiting/rechtliches/nutzungsbedingungen-bewerber/): 1.2 only for "die individuelle
  Arbeitssuche natürlicher Personen", no other commercial use; **4.3.4 forbids scraping or
  similar techniques to collect content "für einen anderen Zweck"**, to republish it or to use it
  other than for the intended purpose of the services; 13.2 (i) forbids using the platforms "für
  die Entwicklung anderer Dienstleistungen". Its `/agb` address answers 403 even in a browser.
- **Reading of these facts (not legal advice):** each allows a person to download ads for their
  own job search, and Jobcu does only that, on the person's own computer, without republishing.
  But none clearly allows automated reading: StepStone.de names scraping and "developing other
  services", and the Irish sites keep the final say on what counts as competition and ask for
  prior written permission. That is **not "clearly permitted"**, so under the owner's no-legal-risk
  rule they stay on hold. The clean route would be written permission from the Stepstone Group
  for personal, non-commercial, device-local use.

## Checked and not used

- **EURES** (europa.eu/eures), checked 2026-09-17. Technically ideal: `POST
  /eures/api/jv-searchengine/public/jv-search/search` returns full ads with exact creation times
  for all EU/EEA countries (max 50 per page; space-separated keywords mean OR, separate keyword
  entries mean AND; `publicationPeriod` LAST_DAY / LAST_THREE_DAYS / LAST_WEEK / LAST_MONTH;
  keyword codes EVERYWHERE / TITLE / DESCRIPTION / EMPLOYER; europa.eu robots.txt asks for a
  10 s crawl delay). **Not used:** the "Find a job" terms say users may not use "screen
  scraping" or any other automated system to extract vacancy data to process it further, and
  that only EURES partner organisations recognised by a National Coordination Office may extract
  data using the API. Its jobs come from public employment services Jobcu reads directly
  (Bundesagentur, JobsIreland) or may read later.
- **EURES-style aggregators needing a publisher website** (Jooble, Careerjet) are still open
  questions: their free keys are meant for websites showing their jobs, and Jobcu has no website.
  The owner decides whether to sign up.
- **publicjobs.ie** (Ireland's public service recruiter) and **UK Civil Service Jobs**, checked
  2026-09-17: both answer automated requests with a bot check instead of the page
  (publicjobs.ie serves an obfuscated JavaScript challenge, Civil Service Jobs a "Quick Check
  Needed" page). Jobcu never works around bot protection, so neither is used.
- **The Muse API**: public and documented, but registration is expected for real use and the jobs
  are mostly American. Kept as an option.
- **UK Find a Job (DWP)**, findajob.dwp.gov.uk, checked 2026-09-17. Requests with Jobcu's
  User-Agent time out, and a browser-like request gets a web-application-firewall page ("Something
  went wrong"). That's bot protection, so Jobcu doesn't use it.

## LinkedIn, StepStone and the person's AI searching the web (checked 2026-09-24)

Legitimate routes only (DECISIONS.md, 2026-09-24 later): Jobcu never opens their pages.

- **No partner route to read jobs.** LinkedIn's only job API is the Job Posting API, for
  approved ATS and staffing partners to **post** jobs, and it isn't taking new partners; there is
  no API to search or read listings. StepStone publishes no partner API for reading jobs either
  (only third-party scrapers exist, which Jobcu never uses). Written permission from the Stepstone
  Group stays the only direct route (above, "Job boards on hold").
- **The person's AI searching the web for single jobs** (tried 2026-09-24, not shipped;
  DECISIONS.md): Gemini's answers come with its sources as
  `vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/…` links, and that site's robots.txt
  disallows `/grounding-api-redirect` for every crawler, so Jobcu may not follow them; the
  addresses the model writes itself are often altered (an ID left out). At low effort (the cloud)
  it searched only once or twice per country.
- **For the local check's coverage list only** (a person's own browsing, never Jobcu): LinkedIn's
  public job search (`linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=…&location=…&f_TPR=r259200`, the last 3
  days) and StepStone's lists (`stepstone.de/jobs/{words}?ag=age_3`) could be read on 2026-09-24,
  60 and 25 jobs a page, with company, place and "2 days ago".
- **Some StepStone jobs already arrive legitimately:** Le Forem's open data carries 402 StepStone
  Belgium ads and 10,284 from Jobat (Belgium, above).
- **How many StepStone jobs Jobcu misses (a sample):** of 7 fresh StepStone nursing jobs in
  Hamburg (Schön Klinik, B. Braun, Israelitisches Krankenhaus, a care provider, an agency), the
  Bundesagentur had **1** (B. Braun's). Employers' own sites are varied (hospital sites, two of
  which didn't even answer), so no single career system reaches them.
- **The person's AI searching the web (Gemini `gemini-3.8-flash`, Google Search grounding, medium
  thinking), four made-up people, "posted in the last 3 days":**

  | Person | Web searches | Jobs listed | Sites | Output tokens | Time |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | ICU nurse, Cork | 8 | 7 | healthcarejobs.ie, IrishJobs, Indeed, Rezoomo (HSE), JobLeads | 3,253 | 18 s |
  | Primary-school teacher, Ghent | 5 | 9 | VDAB (8), Indeed | 5,830 | 22 s |
  | Sous-chef, Zürich | 5 | 15 | hotelcareer.ch, jobs.ch, Jooble, Indeed | 4,379 | 13 s |
  | Nurse, Hamburg | 4 | 7+ | StepStone (all) | 8,176 | 27 s |

  **The jobs were real and fresh** (titles, employers and "1 day ago", "Online sinds 23 sep."
  as the search results show them), **but the links weren't reliable:** Indeed links with made-up
  IDs (`jk=clinical-nurse-manager-2-icu-mater-private-cork`), one VDAB ID given for two different
  schools, list pages instead of job pages (jobs.ch, hotelcareer.ch, Jooble), and for Hamburg only
  Google's grounding redirect links. So an AI-found job needs checking before it is shown
  (HANDOVER §9.6): reading its page where Jobcu may read it, or finding the same job at the
  employer or another permitted source. Cost per person and query: about 3,000–8,000 output
  tokens (≈ $0.01–0.03) and 4–8 grounded searches (Gemini's 5,000 free a month, then $14 per
  1,000).
- **Cloud check note:** Python 3.13 needed a relaxed certificate flag for the proxy (AGENTS.md,
  "Working in a cloud session").

## Candidate sources by country (research from 2026-09-24, not built yet)

Found while mapping sources for every kind of work, in the owner's order of countries. Each entry
says what was checked live and what still needs checking. When one is built, its facts move to
its own section above. The ranking and what waits on the owner are in PROGRESS.md.

### Germany

What Jobcu already has covers every trade: the Bundesagentur's Jobbörse (all professions), Adzuna,
Arbeitnow and the career systems. The gaps are the public sector and employers on German career
systems the directory doesn't read.

- **service.bund.de:** built (above).
- **Interamt (interamt.de, checked 2026-09-24):** the largest public-sector portal (about 60,000
  jobs a year, run by DVZ Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). robots.txt closes only `/cms/` to every
  crawler and closes the job pages (`/koop/`) to Jooble's, Yandex's, Ahrefs' and Majestic's
  crawlers. The terms of use say nothing about automated reading; they describe searching job
  offers and applying. Said to offer RSS feeds (not found yet). **Not reachable from cloud
  sessions:** its certificate chains to "Telekom Security TLS RSA Root 2023", which the cloud
  proxy's bundle lacks (certifi has it, so Jobcu on a computer can reach it). Overlap with
  service.bund.de still to be measured.
- **d.vinci:** built as a career system (above).
- **softgarden:** its Jobs API needs OAuth credentials from softgarden's support, so it isn't
  usable; its career pages (`{company}.softgarden.io`) could be read through `jobposting.py` if
  they carry JobPosting data (not checked).

### The UK and Ireland

What Jobcu already has: Reed, Adzuna (UK only), Arbeitnow's UK list, jobs.ac.uk, EURAXESS,
JobsIreland.ie and the career systems. Missing: schools, the health services and councils,
which employ a large share of people in both countries and rarely post on commercial boards.

- **Teaching Vacancies:** built (above).
- **NHS Jobs:** built (above).
- **To check when building for the UK:** NHS Scotland (`apply.jobs.scot.nhs.uk`, no robots.txt);
  myjobscotland (Scotland's councils: robots.txt closes `/api/`; its sitemap lists categories and
  organisations, not single jobs); HSC jobs in Northern Ireland (`jobs.hscni.net`, no
  robots.txt).
- **Ireland, to check when building:** the HSE's CareerHub (`careerhub.hse.ie`, a WordPress site
  whose RSS feed is its WordPress posts, not jobs; robots.txt empty); **educationposts.ie** (Irish school jobs; robots.txt closes
  `/api/`, `/teacher/` and account pages; its job list address wasn't found at `/posts/`).
  publicjobs.ie refuses automated requests (above).

### Switzerland

What Jobcu already has: Adzuna (CH), Arbeitnow's list (some Swiss jobs), EURAXESS and the career
systems. No Swiss public or national source yet.

- **Job-Room (job-room.ch, SECO's public employment service, checked 2026-09-24):** its
  robots.txt closes `/job-search/` to every crawler, and its official **Jobs API is for
  employers posting jobs** (access by e-mail to jobroom-api@seco.admin.ch), not for reading them.
  Not usable. (Jobs under the Swiss registration duty are shown only to registered job seekers
  for their first five working days anyway.)
- **prospective.ch:** built as a career system (above).
- **jobs.ch (JobCloud):** robots.txt closes `/api/`, `/external/` and many paths; a commercial
  board, not checked further.

### Belgium

- **Le Forem's open data:** built (above).
- **VDAB (Flanders' public employment service):** a developer portal (developer.vdab.be) with a
  Vacatures API (search, bulk list of new and changed vacancies; up to 2,000 calls a minute are
  mentioned). Free, but each user needs **an account and a subscription**, like Adzuna's key;
  the terms show only after signing in. Not tested.
- **Actiris (Brussels):** not checked; Le Forem's data already carries 1,554 Brussels offers.
- **School jobs (checked 2026-09-24):** Le Forem's data had no primary-teacher jobs in a day.
  **Flemish schools** enter their vacancies in **VDAB's database** ("My VDAB"), from where they
  also reach the Department of Education's own list: VDAB showed 2,479 education and 1,656
  teacher vacancies. So VDAB's API is the route to Flemish school jobs (the per-person key
  question in PROGRESS.md). Other Flemish boards named by KU Leuven's guide: Onderwijsvacatures,
  Lesgeven in Vlaanderen, Katholiek Onderwijs Vlaanderen, GO! Onderwijs, city school boards.
  **French-speaking schools** (Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles) recruit differently: yearly calls
  for candidates each January (published in the Moniteur belge and on enseignement.be), and
  **Primoweb**, where teachers declare they are available and schools offer them hours; free
  (Catholic) schools also post on jobecole.be. None of these checked for automated reading yet.

### The Netherlands

- **Werken voor Nederland:** built (above).
- **werk.nl (UWV):** robots.txt closes only `/webpublicaties`; how its vacancies can be read
  wasn't checked (a request for them as open data exists on data.overheid.nl, so there is none).
- **Nationale Vacaturebank (DPG Media):** its firewall refuses Jobcu's requests ("Access Denied"),
  even for robots.txt. Not usable.

### Italy

- **InPA (inpa.gov.it, the public administration's recruitment portal, checked 2026-09-24):** the
  notices page loads its data from `portale.inpa.gov.it/concorsi-smart/api/concorso-public-area/
  search-better`, and **portale.inpa.gov.it's robots.txt disallows everything**. Not usable.
- Italy's public employment service (SIISL, formerly Cliclavoro/MyANPAL) wasn't checked. Adzuna
  covers Italy today.

### Denmark, Norway and Sweden

- **Sweden:** built (Arbetsförmedlingen, above).
- **NAV Arbeidsplassen (Norway):** built (above).
- **Jobnet, Denmark's public job service (STAR, checked 2026-09-24):** every address answers a
  redirect to MitID login, even robots.txt, for automated requests. STAR offers a **Jobnet web
  service** to import its job ads into one's own portal, free, by agreement (spoc@star.dk). Asking
  would be the owner's decision.

### Poland

- **CBOP (Centralna Baza Ofert Pracy, the labour offices' central database, checked
  2026-09-24):** the ministry provides **two web services for outside parties to download job
  offers automatically**, under "Warunki udostępniania informacji o ofertach pracy z CBOP" and an
  instruction PDF (`oferty.praca.gov.pl/portal/instrukcja_pobierania_danych_z_cbop.pdf`, which
  now returns the portal's page instead of the PDF). Since the 2025 labour market law the portal
  is ePraca (a JavaScript app); no robots.txt. Whether the web services need an agreement, and
  what they return today, is still to be checked.

## General observations

- In 815 real ads (Reed + Bundesagentur, one week, electronics roles), **employer links almost
  never pointed to company career systems** (Greenhouse, Personio, Workday and similar). They
  pointed to company homepages, staffing agencies (Ferchau, Brunel, Akkodis, Hays…) or other
  boards. Career systems therefore need the employer directory (Phase 3).
- German engineering ads include many from staffing agencies, often near-identical for different
  clients (see duplicate rules in `dedupe.py`).
